			<h2>dessert</h2>
			<p>There’s nothing like the joy that comes from ending your meal with a sweet, homemade dessert. They make any occasion feel extra-special, from birthdays to anniversaries to potlucks and everyday dinners. But what if you’re, ahem, not super confident in the kitchen? Fear not, these desserts look like a professional made them, but are actually so easy to put together! From cakes to bars to pies and even dessert dips, you’ll be able to master these recipes in no time.

                What makes these recipes so easy, you may ask? We've included many desserts that are ready in under an hour (some even in 10 minutes!), so you're not slaving away in the kitchen prepping a towering dessert all day long. Our no-bake desserts couldn't be easier to prep ahead of time, with the majority of their time spent chillin' in the fridge 'til you're ready to serve. Of course, we didn't forget one of our favorite easy desserts: poke cakes. If you're unfamiliar, it's all in the name—they’re baked, poked, then filled with a sweet syrup or milk to add extra flavor. Basically, they're foolproof delicious and a super way to impress without all the fuss of a layer cake.
